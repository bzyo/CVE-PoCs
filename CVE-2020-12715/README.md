# Vulnerability
PacsOne Server 6.8.4 suffers from Incorrect Access Control.

# Prerequisites
To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be authenticated and have the ability to upload<br>

# Exploit
The Dicom Image upload does not restrict file types allowing authenticated users with the ability to upload malicious code. While the upload folder does not list the files, the uploaded files are in a predicatable format as shown below.  

```
Format:
date-time-username-filename.extension

Example:
20200926-134416-user1-winrev.php
```

An authenticaed or unauthenticaed user can access these files after upload and gain access to the system.  Depending on how the web server is configured to run will determine what level of privileges to the server.
