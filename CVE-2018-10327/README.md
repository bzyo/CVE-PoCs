# Vulnerability
PrinterOn Enterprise 4.1.3 stores the Active Directory bind credentials using base64 encoding, which allows local users to obtain credentials for a domain user by reading the cps_config.xml file

# Prerequisites
To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have access to a system running PrinterOn Enterprise using a low-privileged user account and LDAP bind account must be in use.

#  Exploit
Opening the cps_config.xml reveals bindPW for an Active Directory user in base64 encoding that can be easily decoded.
